    <!--This was how I first made my html, using button-black/yellow and size as
    two different class selectors to make multiple selections to two lines.  Now I
  use a comma in CSS in between multiple selectors
EXAMPLE
  button-black,
  button-yellow {
    font-size: 34px;
}
-->
    <button class="button-black">Click Me!</button>
    <button class="button-yellow">No, Click Me!</button>
